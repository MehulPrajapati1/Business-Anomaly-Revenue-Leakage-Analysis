# Business-Anomaly-Revenue-Leakage-Analysis
I recently completed an end-to-end data analytics project focused on identifying business anomalies and revenue leakage in retail sales data.

🔍 Problem Statement
Many organizations lose revenue silently due to pricing errors, excessive discounts, process issues, and negative-profit transactions. These losses are often hidden in day-to-day reports.

📊 What I Did
Cleaned and validated raw sales data using Excel and SQL
Built a rule-based anomaly detection system to identify:
Negative profit orders
Free product transactions (sales = 0, quantity > 0)
Excessive discount scenarios
Operational date inconsistencies
Calculated revenue leakage amount using business logic
Performed category, sub-category, product, customer, and time-based analysis
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard connected to SQL for decision-making insights

📈 Key Insights
Excessive discounting was the primary driver of revenue leakage
Certain categories and sub-categories consistently generated losses
Monthly trend analysis revealed high-risk periods requiring pricing control
Repeated loss-making customers highlighted potential policy misuse

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
SQL (Data Cleaning, CASE logic, Aggregations, Views)
Excel (Initial validation & structuring)
Power BI (KPIs, trend analysis, root cause visuals)
Business Analytics & Data Modeling

💡 Business Impact
This analysis helps stakeholders:
Identify where money is leaking
Optimize pricing and discount strategies
Improve operational and financial controls

📌 This project strengthened my ability to translate raw data into actionable business insights, not just dashboards.
